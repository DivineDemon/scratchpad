# UK Financial Conduct Authority - Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines

**Last Updated:** December 22, 2025  
**Version:** 2.2
**Jurisdiction:** United Kingdom

## Overview

This document outlines the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements for financial institutions operating in the United Kingdom, as mandated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

## Key Requirements

### Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

All financial institutions must:

1. Verify customer identity before establishing a business relationship
2. Conduct ongoing monitoring of customer transactions
3. Maintain records for a minimum of 5 years
4. Report suspicious activities to the National Crime Agency (NCA)

### Risk Assessment

Institutions must perform risk assessments:

- **Low Risk:** Standard CDD procedures apply
- **Medium Risk:** Enhanced due diligence required
- **High Risk:** Additional verification and monitoring mandatory

### New Requirement (Added January 2024)

All institutions must now implement real-time transaction monitoring systems by Q4 2024.

### Reporting Obligations

Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) must be filed within 24 hours of detection.

### **Enhanced Due Diligence and High-Risk Jurisdictions**

All institutions must adopt a **risk-based approach** to customer due diligence, with appropriate escalation to **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)** for higher-risk situations. Higher risk can arise from customer relationships, transaction types, geographic exposure, or complex ownership structures. EDD must be *documented and proportionate to the risk identified*, including verified source of funds and source of wealth where appropriate.

For geographic risk, institutions are required to apply **enhanced measures** where customers or transactions are linked to **High-Risk Third Countries (HRTCs)** as defined by the UK’s AML framework, aligned to the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) lists**. EDD must be applied for **new and existing relationships** where either counterparty is established in an HRTC, and ongoing monitoring must reflect the higher risk profile. 

**Enhanced Due Diligence includes:**

- Verifying additional identifying information establishing beneficial ownership and control structures.
- Confirming and documenting source of funds and wealth.
- Applying enhanced ongoing transaction monitoring with appropriate escalation triggers.
- Recording rationale for risk classification and mitigation decisions.

Institutions should ensure EDD procedures are *proportionate, risk-sensitive and consistently applied*, with escalation to senior compliance and MLROs where significant risk indicators are present.

### **Transaction Monitoring, Reporting and Oversight Enhancements**

All institutions must implement **effective systems and controls** for ongoing transaction monitoring as part of their AML compliance framework. Transaction monitoring systems should be capable of identifying unusual or suspicious patterns across customer activity, including complex, high-value, cross-border and high-risk transactions. Monitoring must be **risk-sensitive, continuously updated, and support escalation workflows** that trigger internal review and external reporting where necessary.

The FCA’s updated Financial Crime Guide emphasises that transaction monitoring should be integrated with broader financial crime controls, including sanctions screening and behavioural analytics, rather than treated as a stand-alone, rule-based process. Firms are expected to **assess the adequacy of these systems regularly**, document performance metrics and address any control gaps identified through testing or supervisory review.

Institutions must ensure **timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)** are filed for any activity that gives rise to suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crime. SAR submissions should be made through the National Crime Agency’s secure SAR Portal and should include all relevant contextual information to support law enforcement analysis.

Oversight of monitoring and reporting must be embedded in governance frameworks with **clear accountability at senior management level**. Firms are expected to demonstrate ongoing management review of monitoring outputs, investigation outcomes and reporting timeliness as part of internal audit and compliance assurance routines.

## Compliance Deadlines

- **Q1 2024:** All institutions must complete risk assessments
- **Q2 2024:** Enhanced monitoring systems must be operational
- **Q3 2024:** Staff training programs must be completed
- **Q4 2024:** Real-time monitoring systems must be implemented (NEW)
